# project-hop-in-the-cloud

## Hop Config

Set HOP_HOME to the `project-a` directory (absolute path) when using Hop locally.

Example:

```
export HOP_HOME=/Users/diethardsteiner/git/project-hop-in-the-cloud/project-a
export HOP_METASTORE_FOLDER=/Users/diethardsteiner/git/project-hop-in-the-cloud/project-a
```

## OPEN

- metastore: `HOP_METASTORE_HOME` does not seem to be working
- parameters - testing only: still a bug in hop-gui preventing me from defining parameters.
- environment flag for hop-run ... requires environment plugin? Not really or ... this is just for the gui.
